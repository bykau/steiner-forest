# steiner-forest
A dynamic programming implementation of the Steiner Forest algorithm which was used in [1] and extends the state-of-the-art optimal algorithm
for the Steiner tree problem presented in [2]. The time complexity of the Steiner Forest algorithm is ![Alt text](/img/time_complexity.png?raw=true) with space requirement
